# Tax calculator

This is a set of tools aimed to facilitate shares accounting and to ease a tax form filling routine 
for both long-term investors and in-day traders.  

Currently, project consists of two parts:
* [capital gains calculator](./capital-gains-calculator)  (whenever you sell an asset you need to pay income tax in respect of the profit)
* [dividend calculator](./dividend-calculator) (even if you don't sell anything you still might receive a taxable dividend as a shareholder)

You can use these tools either as standalone CLI application or via [tax-calculator-api](./tax-calculator-api) 
which is deployed to a cloud application platform.
